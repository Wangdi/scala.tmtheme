I started from [Vibrant Ink](http://alternateidea.com/blog/articles/2006/01/03/textmate-vibrant-ink-theme-and-prototype-bundle) and started slashing toward scala highlighting I could live with.  It makes no pretense of being useful for anything but scala (and depending on your tastes, quite possibly not even that.) It will work best in tandem with [this textmate bundle](http://github.com/paulp/scala.tmbundle).
